const PI = 3.14;
PI = 42 // Error, can not reassign a const variable

1. Let is not hoisted vs Var
   Let can not be redeclared vs Var
   Let is block-scoped vs Var

2. Same as first plus:
   Const can't be reassigned vs Var

3. The only difference between let and const is that const
   variables can NOT be reassigned.

4. Hoisting is when variable declaration is "moved" on the top of their scope
   and variable can be accessed before any value is assigned
